# Facial Morphing

Upload two images and generate a set of 45 images morphing image 1 into image 2, which can then be turned into a morph sequence gif.

## How to run

Run the code by running python3 morph.py <path  to  image  1>  <path  to  image  2>

The 45 morph sequence images will be saved in the current directory.

You will be asked to pick 44 facial key points for each image. Pick the first 4 as the corners of the image, then pick key points on each face. Make sure the correspondence points are picked in exactly the same order for both images.
